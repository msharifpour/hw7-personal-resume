                <h2 class="text-secondary">Programmer for an app called "Foodegy"</h2>
                <p>During my time at California State University of Northridge, I have worked on a group project for an entire semester; where 5 people including myself were involvd in creating a food related application.</p>

                <p>During the early stages of brain storming about Foodegy, our main goal was to make sure that the application runs seamlessly not only on one platform but other as well. For instance, we decided to use React Native in order to make our application compatable on both Apple's IOS platform as well as Google's Android platforms. So by doing that, we were able to save time and dedicate more time in designing our application.</p>

                <p>Now, lets dive deep into what the Foodegy does. First, Foodegy is a mobile app where a user will utilize it’s features which will help decide where they
                should eat at a restaurant if they are unsure of what they would like to eat. The app will display restaurants within a 1 mile radius of the user one
                by one, and the user will swipe left or right on the restaurant depending on if they are in the mood for that cuisine or not, left for “not in the mood”
                and right for “in the mood.” One the user has swiped right on N (yet to be determined) amount of restaurants, we will use a function that selects
                one of N the restaurants at random for the user to eat at. The app will display the price, ratings, address, pictures, and phone number of the
                restaurant that is selected. </p>

                <p>Furthermore, the app will not allow the user to order through our app but we implemented a feature that lets the user know if the restaurant allows for orders through services like “Door Dash” and “Grub Hub” respectively. In addition, some of the benifits of using Foodegy is that it include easy usage, great suggestions, and a fun and engaging way to help those who are indecisive. Our goal is to help those who have trouble picking places to eat out at.</p>

                <p>Lastly, It is the mission of Foodegy to create an application that is accessible to as many users as possible. Foodegy supports two categories of users: Authorized users that have created a profile and guests. Users who opt to create a profile will enjoy many perks such as the ability to favorite restaurants, look at their swiping history and restaurants they have visited in the past. Foodegy has 5 core subsystems that demonstrate these core behaviors.</p>

                    <p>Self-Evaluation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When looking back at all the work that went into creating our application “Foodegy”, I believe that I have contributed a fair amount of work towards the group. Since most of the materials that we used towards the application was fairly new to me, for instance, I had to learning how to code in a new programming language called “React Native” where I had no prior experience before hand. I also believe that I have put a little bit of extra effort and time to learn react native faster in order to get a head start, so that I can actually have more time to spent towards perfecting the application.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Responsible For Creating: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main Button</li>
                        <li>History feature/funcitionality</li>
                        <li>Recommendation page</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Last but not least, I was responsible for making a “Main button” (which is listed above) where within the button it had other buttons which helped users to navigate through the app; and by how Foodegy turned out, I firmly believe that I have done a good enough job on my part because of the positive feedback that I have got from the rest my group members. Lastly, I made sure to not only have a good communication but also to make time for whenever some of my group members asked me to do a specific task by delivering it on time.</p>
